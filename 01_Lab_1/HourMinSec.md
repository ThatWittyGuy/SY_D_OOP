## Line-by-Line Code Explanation

### 1. `import java.util.Scanner;`
- Purpose: Imports the Scanner class from java.util package
- Reason: Allows user input from keyboard/console
- Enables reading different types of input (integers, strings)

### 2. `public class HourMinSec {`
- Purpose: Defines a public class named "HourMinSec"
- Reason: 
  - Every Java program must have a class
  - "public" means the class can be accessed from anywhere
  - Contains the main program logic for time conversion

### 3. `public static void main(String[] args) {`
- Purpose: Entry point of the Java program
- Detailed breakdown:
  - `public`: Accessible from anywhere
  - `static`: Can be called without creating an object instance
  - `void`: Method doesn't return any value
  - `String[] args`: Allows command-line arguments
- Reason: Java runtime automatically calls this method when program starts

### 4. `Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);`
- Purpose: Creates a Scanner object to read user input
- Components:
  - `System.in`: Standard input stream (keyboard)
  - `new`: Creates a new Scanner instance
- Reason: Enables interactive console input for the program

### 5. `System.out.print("Enter total seconds: ");`
- Purpose: Displays input prompt to user
- Difference from `println()`: Doesn't move cursor to next line
- Reason: Guides user to enter total seconds for conversion

### 6. `int totalSeconds = sc.nextInt();`
- Purpose: Reads user input as an integer
- `int`: Integer data type to store whole number of seconds
- Reason: Captures total seconds for time conversion calculation

### 7. `int hours = totalSeconds / 3600;`
- Purpose: Calculates hours from total seconds
- Calculation: Divide total seconds by 3600 (seconds in an hour)
- Reason: Integer division automatically floors the result
- Example: 7200 seconds รท 3600 = 2 hours

### 8. `int minutes = (totalSeconds % 3600) / 60;`
- Purpose: Calculates remaining minutes
- Detailed steps:
  - `totalSeconds % 3600`: Finds remaining seconds after extracting hours
  - Divide remaining seconds by 60 to get minutes
- Reason: Precise minute calculation after hour extraction

### 9. `int seconds = totalSeconds % 60;`
- Purpose: Calculates remaining seconds
- `%` (modulo) operator finds remainder after division by 60
- Reason: Extracts seconds that don't form complete minutes

### 10. `System.out.println(hours + "HR  " + minutes + "MIN  " + seconds + "S  ");`
- Purpose: Displays converted time
- Concatenates:
  - Hours with "HR" suffix
  - Minutes with "MIN" suffix
  - Seconds with "S" suffix
- Reason: Provides user-friendly time representation

### 11. `sc.close();`
- Purpose: Closes the Scanner object
- Reason: 
  - Prevents resource leaks
  - Good programming practice
  - Releases system resources used by Scanner
