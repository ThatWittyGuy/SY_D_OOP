## Line-by-Line Code Explanation

### 1. `import java.util.Scanner;`
- Purpose: Imports the Scanner class from java.util package
- Reason: Allows user input from keyboard/console
- Scanner provides methods to read different types of input (integers, strings, etc.)

### 2. `public class operators {`
- Purpose: Defines a public class named "operators"
- Reason: Every Java program must have a class
- "public" means the class can be accessed from anywhere
- Contains the main logic of the program

### 3. `public static void main(String[] args) {`
- Purpose: Entry point of the Java program
- Components breakdown:
  - `public`: Accessible from anywhere
  - `static`: Can be called without creating an object
  - `void`: Method doesn't return any value
  - `String[] args`: Command-line arguments array
- Reason: Java runtime calls this method automatically when program starts

### 4. `Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);`
- Purpose: Creates a Scanner object to read user input
- `System.in`: Standard input stream (keyboard)
- `new`: Creates a new instance of Scanner
- Reason: Enables interactive input from the console

### 5. `System.out.println("Enter operator: ");`
- Purpose: Displays a prompt to the user
- `System.out`: Standard output stream
- `println()`: Prints text and moves cursor to next line
- Reason: Provides user guidance for input

### 6. `char operator = sc.next().charAt(0);`
- Purpose: Reads the first character of user's input as an operator
- `sc.next()`: Reads next input as a string
- `.charAt(0)`: Extracts first character
- Reason: Captures mathematical operator (+, -, *, /)

### 7. `System.out.println("Enter first number:");`
- Purpose: Prompts user to enter first number
- Reason: Guides user input for calculation

### 8. `double num1 = sc.nextDouble();`
- Purpose: Reads first number as a decimal
- `double`: Supports decimal numbers
- Reason: Allows precise mathematical calculations

### 9-11. Similar steps for second number input

### 12. `double result = 0;`
- Purpose: Initializes result variable
- Reason: Ensures variable is declared before use in switch statement

### 13. `switch(operator) {`
- Purpose: Performs different calculations based on operator
- Reason: Provides a clean, readable way to handle multiple conditions

### 14-25. Switch Case Blocks
- Purpose: Perform specific mathematical operations
- Cases: Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*), Division (/)
- `break`: Exits switch after executing a case
- Division case includes division by zero check

### 26. `System.out.println("Result: " + result);`
- Purpose: Displays calculation result
- Reason: Provides output to user

### 27. `sc.close();`
- Purpose: Closes the Scanner
- Reason: Prevents resource leaks, good programming practice
